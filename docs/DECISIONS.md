# Decision Log

Lightweight architecture decision records. Add an entry for each real choice between alternatives,
each deviation from a spec, each accepted vulnerability, and each change to the content-type set
(`DOC-010`). Code affected by a deviation carries `SPEC-DEVIATION: D-xxx`.

Entries D-001 to D-007 **correct the original development plan**
(`HVL_Interaktiv_Development_Plan.pdf`). The facts behind them were checked on 2026-10-16 against
the npm registry, the published package source and public CVE records. Evaluators can re-check them
with the commands given.

---

### D-001 · Node.js 24 LTS instead of 22
- **Context:** The plan specifies Node 22 LTS. `ltijs@7.0.7`, the current maintained release,
  declares `"engines": { "node": ">=24" }`. Node 24 is an LTS line supported until April 2028.
- **Decision:** Target Node.js 24 LTS (`.nvmrc`, Docker `node:24-*` images, `engines` field).
- **Consequences:** Development containers that ship Node 22 must install Node 24. Revisit once
  Node 26 becomes LTS.
- **Re-check:** `npm view ltijs@7 engines`.

### D-002 · Pin `@lumieducation/h5p-server@10.0.4` and `h5p-express@10.0.5`
- **Context:** The plan says "lock to version 10.1.0 or newer". No such version exists. The latest
  `h5p-server` is 10.0.4 (2025-03-08) and the latest `h5p-express` is 10.0.5.
- **Decision:** Pin the exact versions (`SEC-007`). Watch the upstream repository for a release that
  fixes CVE-2025-7062 (see D-003).
- **Re-check:** `npm view @lumieducation/h5p-server versions`.

### D-003 · Own SVG sanitising and defensive file serving
- **Context:** CVE-2025-7062 (stored XSS through uploaded files) affects h5p-server versions up to and
  including 10.0.4. 10.0.4 removed `svg` from the default allowlist, but it still identifies files
  by extension only. No fixed version is published. (CVE-2025-47828, which the plan also cites, is a
  different bug, fixed in 9.3.3.)
- **Decision:** Defence in depth: `@lumieducation/h5p-svg-sanitizer` plus our own extra rules
  (`SEC-001`), magic-byte sniffing (`SEC-002`), a separate file origin with `CSP: sandbox` (`SEC-004`),
  and a narrowed allowlist.
- **Consequences:** Slightly slower uploads. SVG stays usable for diagrams.
- **Re-check:** OSV and NVD entries for CVE-2025-7062; the h5p-server CHANGELOG.

### D-004 · Library installation is a `GeneralPermission`
- **Context:** The plan restricts `ContentPermission.InstallRecommended`. In h5p-server 10.0.4 the
  enum is `GeneralPermission` (`CreateRestricted`, `InstallRecommended`, `UpdateAndInstallLibraries`).
- **Decision:** Use `GeneralPermission.*`, admin-only (`H5P-006`).
- **Re-check:** `build/src/types.d.ts` in the installed package.

### D-005 · ltijs 7 with a PostgreSQL `DatabaseManager`
- **Context:** The plan describes the ltijs 5 API (`lti.setup(…, { ltiaas: true })`) with
  `ltijs-postgresql`. ltijs 7 is a TypeScript rewrite: `Provider`, `LaunchContext`, a cookie-less ltik
  (24 h), and a pluggable 14-method `DatabaseManager` that ships with MongoDB only.
  `ltijs-postgresql` and `ltijs-sequelize` were last published in 2022 and target v5.
- **Alternatives:** (a) ltijs 5 with sequelize: legacy and unmaintained. (b) Add MongoDB just for
  LTI: a second database to run and back up. (c) Implement `DatabaseManager` on Prisma/PostgreSQL:
  about 14 small methods.
- **Decision:** (c), as `PrismaLtiDatabaseManager` (`LTI-002`). Keep ltijs behind our own
  `LtiProviderFactory` so a future library change stays local.
- **Re-check:** `npm view ltijs@7 dependencies`; `services/database-manager/database-manager.types.d.ts`.

### D-006 · Branching Scenario replaces Drag and Drop in the ten types
- **Context:** `H5P.DragQuestion` is popular, but free 2-D dragging is a well-known barrier for
  keyboard, switch and screen-reader users (WCAG 2.1.1, 2.5.7). Case-based judgement is central to
  HVL's professional programmes.
- **Decision:** Exclude DragQuestion from authoring, including as sub-content; include
  `H5P.BranchingScenario` (`H5P-002`).

### D-007 · Two-tone focus ring instead of an orange outline
- **Context:** The plan pairs coastal teal with a `#FF9E1B` focus outline. Measured contrast against
  white is 2.07 : 1, which fails WCAG 1.4.11 (needs 3 : 1). The plan also overstated two feedback
  contrast ratios (7.21 : 1 and 7.08 : 1 measured; both still pass).
- **Decision:** `outline: 3px solid` HVL Mørk blå 2 (`#004357`, 10.82 : 1 on white; originally `#003D4C`,
  changed by D-017) with a 2 px white inner ring, which works on light and dark surfaces (`UD-004`).
  Contrast is tested in CI from the tokens (`UD-001`). `#FF9E1B` is not an HVL colour; HVL's orange is
  Oransje `#EB6851`. It clears 3 : 1 on white only narrowly (3.17 : 1), so it stays decorative.

### D-008 · Formative use only
H5P scores in the browser, so scores can be forged. AGS scores are labelled formative and the UI
says so (`LTI-013`, `PROD-011`). Exams stay in Wiseflow.

### D-009 · Nynorsk first, with Bokmål and English fallback
HVL's main administrative language is Nynorsk. i18next uses `nn → nb → en` for both UI and H5P
strings (`H5P-008`, `PROD-012`).

### D-010 · Teachers see aggregates only, with *k* = 5
- **Context:** Insight helps teaching decisions. Individual grades already exist in Canvas through AGS.
- **Decision:** No per-learner insight endpoint. Suppress groups smaller than *k* = 5, with
  complementary suppression (`INS-006`).
- **Consequences:** Very small classes see little insight. This is an accepted privacy trade-off,
  and *k* can be lowered to 3 by configuration.

### D-011 · Learners are HMAC pseudonyms with yearly key rotation
`learnerKey = HMAC(secret[academicYear], source)`. Destroying the secret at the yearly purge makes
the remaining aggregates unlinkable (`DATA-002`, `DATA-003`). Resume state does not carry across the
1 August boundary. This is acceptable because the summer break falls there.

### D-012 · One public origin, plus a separate origin for uploaded files
A reverse proxy serves Next.js and Express on one origin, which removes CORS and keeps the portal
cookie first-party. User-uploaded files come from a cookie-less second origin, which limits the
damage any file-borne script can do (`SEC-004`).

### D-013 · Validator errors can be acknowledged rather than hard-blocking
Teachers sometimes publish while captions are still being produced (for example in Panopto). A
hard block would push them to tools with no checks at all. An acknowledgement with a reason is
stored, re-raised after 14 days, and visible in insight and the portfolio export (`PROD-003`, `UD-022`).

### D-014 · English in code, Norwegian domain terms preserved
English makes the code reviewable by international evaluators and the open-source community.
Domain terms such as `forarbeid` or `laeringsutbytte` keep their Norwegian form so teachers and ALU
recognise them. They are explained in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) (`DOC-009`).

### D-015 · Licence GPL-3.0-or-later
- **Context:** `@lumieducation/h5p-server` is GPL-3.0-or-later, so a server that combines with it must be
  GPL-compatible. The other main dependencies are compatible: ltijs (Apache-2.0), marked (MIT), H5P
  content types (MIT).
- **Decision:** The whole repository is licensed **GPL-3.0-or-later**. The repository owner asked
  Claude to confirm the choice on 2026-10-16. `LICENSE` holds the unmodified GPL v3 text. Its SHA-256,
  `3972dc9744f6499f0f9b2dbf76696f2ae7ad8af9b23dde66d6af86c9dfb36986`, is the hash of the FSF's
  `gpl-3.0.txt`, and it was cross-checked against the copy shipped in `@lumieducation/h5p-server`.
- **Consequences:** Anyone who distributes a modified version must release its source under the same
  licence. Network use alone does not trigger that. The HVL name and logo are trademarks of Høgskulen på
  Vestlandet and are **not** licensed by the GPL. Logo files must not be committed without HVL's permission.
  Third-party files keep their own licences, for example `tools/spec-site/vendor/marked.LICENSE.md`.
- **Re-check:** `sha256sum LICENSE`.

### D-016 · Specs beyond the plan's four, plus requirement IDs and traceability
The plan defines four module specs. This repository adds spec 00 (product, users, pedagogy), spec 05
(insight and privacy), the [Documentation Standard](DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md) and
[Evaluator Guide](EVALUATOR-GUIDE.md). Requirement IDs connect spec, code and tests, and
`tools/spec-trace/specTrace.mjs` enforces them. The plan's session structure and its progressive
loading of one spec per session are kept.

### D-017 · Brand tokens follow HVL's design manual
- **Context:** The plan's colours (`#003D4C`, `#005F6B`, `#007681`, `#FF9E1B`, "deep fjord teal", "coastal
  teal") appear in no HVL source. HVL's *Visuell identitet / Profilmanual* (v2.0, February 2017, p. 16)
  defines the logo colours Mørk blå 2 `#004357` (PMS 3035 U) and Sjøgrønn `#00AFBA` (PMS 7710 U), plus
  signal, support and additional colours. The values were read through search extracts of the manual and
  agree with independent transcriptions and with two public copies of the logo
  ([docs/reference/hvl-visual-identity.md](reference/hvl-visual-identity.md)).
- **Decision:** Spec 03 §2 uses Mørk blå 2 for headings, links, primary buttons and the focus ring
  (10.82 : 1 on white), Mørk blå 1 `#008AAF` for non-text UI only (4.00 : 1), Sjøgrønn and Oransje for
  decoration only, Blågrå lys `#C9D5DA` for bands, Mørk rød `#6D2439` for incorrect-answer text.
  Body text stays a neutral near-black `#111111`, because the HVL palette has no text black and its
  greys fail 4.5 : 1. Neutral tokens are labelled as such.
- **Consequences:** CLAUDE.md, `UD-004` and D-007 now name `#004357`. HVL (profil@hvl.no) must confirm the
  values, the four hex/RGB mismatches noted in the reference file, and whether derived shades are allowed.
- **Re-check:** `python3 -I docs/reference/tools/contrast.py`.

### D-018 · Typefaces: Arial and Georgia
- **Context:** The plan specified Inter, Arial and Calibri. HVL's manual names NB Akademie Std (titles,
  captions) and Lyon Text (body) as profile fonts, with **Arial** and **Georgia** as the office
  substitutes. Both profile fonts are commercial; no source shows that HVL holds web-font licences.
- **Decision:** Headings, UI controls and captions use Arial; long-form body text uses Georgia (`UD-002`).
  The licensed profile fonts may be self-hosted in front of these stacks once HVL confirms web licences.
  Inter and Calibri are dropped.
- **Consequences:** No third-party font requests are needed (`DATA-011`).

### D-019 · Phases are course-organisation vocabulary at the model's *mikronivå*
- **Context:** Spec 04 assumed that *Modellen for læringsdesign ved HVL* defines phases. HVL's annual
  report 2024 (p. 23) confirms the model exists. Its only public description (Møgelvang & Isaksen 2025,
  MNT-konferansen) presents an alignment model built on *kontekst*, *kunnskap* and *samskaping*, applied
  across levels from the *læringsøkt* (mikronivå) to the institution, using *baklengs planlegging*. HVL's
  course pages use *forarbeid*, *mellomarbeid* and *etterarbeid* (and *før- og etterarbeid*) for work
  around a *samling*. No HVL page uses *underveis* as a phase name, and it is easily confused with
  *undervegsvurdering* (formative assessment).
  ([docs/reference/hvl-laeringsdesign-model.md](reference/hvl-laeringsdesign-model.md))
- **Decision:** Keep the stable keys `forarbeid`, `underveis`, `etterarbeid`. Label them *Forarbeid*,
  *Mellomarbeid* and *Etterarbeid* (en: *Pre-work*, *Intermediate work*, *Post-work*). Present them as the
  structure of a *læringsøkt* around a *samling*, not as the phases of HVL's model. The studio introduces
  the model itself (kontekst, kunnskap, samskaping; backward planning) and links to its public description.
- **Consequences:** Spec 04 §1, the glossary and the proposed `phases.yaml` change. ALU must confirm the
  labels against the model document.

### D-020 · Portfolio export follows HVL's merit portfolio, as content
- **Context:** The plan cited criteria "1.1–3.2". HVL's 2025 merit call has three main criteria and eleven
  sub-criteria (1.1–1.4, 2.1–2.4, 3.1–3.3), revised for each call. The merit portfolio has three parts:
  Del 1 *samanhengande framstilling* (up to 7 500 words, references excluded), Del 2 *pedagogisk CV*, and
  Del 3 up to 11 attachments including the manager's letter.
  ([docs/reference/hvl-pedagogisk-mappe-criteria.md](reference/hvl-pedagogisk-mappe-criteria.md))
- **Decision:** `MAPPE-002` follows the three-part structure with a criterion table as a reader's guide.
  Criteria texts, the word limit and the attachment limit live in content files keyed by criteria set
  (`hvl-merittering-2025`), so the 2027 call needs only a content change. A promotion (*opprykk*) mode
  waits for ALU to confirm its headings.

### D-021 · The Feide ID token is kept in the server-side session for logout only
- **Context:** Feide's RP-initiated logout requires both `post_logout_redirect_uri` and `id_token_hint`.
  The ID token contains the user's name and e-mail when those attribute groups are released.
- **Decision:** Keep the raw ID token only in the Redis session (encrypted at rest, deleted at logout or
  expiry). Never write it to PostgreSQL or logs. Learner name and e-mail are dropped before anything is
  persisted (`AUTH-003`, `AUTH-004`).

### D-022 · H5P editor 1.28 client files come from a pinned, reviewed commit
- **Context:** `H5P-001` asked for core and editor files from a released, versioned 1.28 package. Core has
  the release tag `1.28.0`. The editor (`h5p-editor-php-library`) has **no** 1.28 release tag: its newest
  semver tag is `1.25`, and 1.28-era code exists only on platform branches and untagged commits. Lumi's own
  `master` pins editor commit `ab2daa18bd61b19e7f8729e22eec88f3b637a868`
  ([seed-package status](reference/h5p-core-1.28-seed-packages/README.md) §5).
- **Decision:** Pin core to tag `1.28.0`. Pin the editor to one reviewed commit (start from Lumi's pin),
  record its per-file SHA-256 in `docs/reference/`, and review the diff before any change. Never track a
  moving branch.
- **Consequences:** `H5P-001` and the CLAUDE.md invariant ("never unreleased H5P git branches") now mean
  "never a moving branch; a pinned commit only where no release exists, with this entry". Revisit when
  H5P tags an editor 1.28 release.

### D-023 · Integration tests use docker compose or CI service containers, not Testcontainers
- **Context:** `H5P-004` names Testcontainers for its integration tests. Testcontainers starts containers
  from inside the test process and needs a Docker socket there. CI runners and many development containers
  (including the one Session 1 was built in, where Docker Hub also rate-limited pulls) do not offer that
  reliably, while GitHub Actions service containers and `docker compose` do.
- **Decision:** Integration tests read `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` and `S3_*` from the environment. Locally,
  `docker compose up -d` provides PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7 and an S3-compatible store; CI uses service
  containers with the same images. Tests that need a service are named `*.int.test.ts` and skip with a
  clear message when the service is not configured, so `npm test` still runs the unit tests anywhere.
- **S3 emulator:** the moto server (`motoserver/moto`, pinned tag) emulates the S3 API in one container
  that needs no start command. GitHub Actions service containers cannot pass a command, which MinIO needs
  (`server /data`), so moto is used both locally and in CI. Production uses any S3-compatible store in the EEA.
- **Consequences:** `H5P-004` and the evaluator guide say "integration tests against PostgreSQL, Redis and
  S3" instead of naming Testcontainers; CLAUDE.md names the emulator instead of MinIO. CI must never skip
  them: `test/support/services.ts` throws when `CI=true` and a service variable is missing.

### D-024 · TypeScript pinned to 6.0.3
- **Context:** TypeScript 7.0 (the native compiler) is the newest release, but `typescript-eslint` 8.72,
  the newest release of the linter we need for typed rules, supports TypeScript `<6.1` only.
- **Decision:** Pin `typescript` 6.0.3. Revisit when `typescript-eslint` supports 7.x.
- **Re-check:** `npm view typescript-eslint@latest peerDependencies`.

### D-025 · Own S3 adapters on AWS SDK v3 instead of `h5p-mongos3`
- **Context:** Lumi's `@lumieducation/h5p-mongos3` stores content metadata in MongoDB and uses AWS SDK v2,
  which reached end of support in September 2025. Our metadata lives in PostgreSQL (`H5P-004`).
- **Decision:** `PrismaContentStorage` keeps metadata and parameters in PostgreSQL and delegates file I/O
  to `S3ContentFileStore`; `S3TemporaryFileStorage` handles temporary files. Both use
  `@aws-sdk/client-s3` v3 and work with any S3-compatible store (MinIO, Ceph, Sikt's object storage).
- **Consequences:** We own these adapters and their tests. Lumi's `h5p-mongos3` source is a reference for
  edge cases (key sanitising, range reads), not a dependency.

### D-026 · Library storage on a shared volume until deployment needs S3
- **Context:** `H5P-004` allows S3- or file-system-backed library storage. Libraries change only when an
  admin installs or updates a content type, are read on every page view, and are cached by Lumi's
  `CachedLibraryStorage` (backed by the shared Redis key-value store).
- **Decision:** S1 uses Lumi's `FileLibraryStorage` on a volume shared by all server instances, wrapped
  in `CachedLibraryStorage`. An S3 `ILibraryStorage` is added in S6 only if the target platform has no
  shared volume.
- **Consequences:** Deployment (S6, `NFR-007`) must mount one volume for `H5P_LIBRARY_DIR` on every node.

### D-027 · H5P core and editor files are fetched and verified, not committed
- **Context:** The server needs H5P's client files (core tag `1.28.0`, editor commit per D-022). Committing
  about 1 000 third-party files would bury our own code in reviews and diffs.
- **Decision:** `tools/h5p-core/fetchCoreClients.sh` fetches them into `apps/server/h5p/` (git-ignored).
  Core files are checked against the committed per-file SHA-256 list; the editor is pinned by commit hash
  (git verifies it). CI runs the script before the tests. The server refuses to start when the core API
  version in the fetched files is not 1.28 (`H5P-001`).
- **Consequences:** A fresh clone needs one `npm run h5p:fetch-core`. doc-lint and spec-trace skip
  `apps/server/h5p/`.

### D-028 · The H5P user-data adapter moves to S2 with `H5P-005`
- **Context:** `H5P-004` (S1) lists `IContentUserDataStorage`, but the adapter's key and behaviour are
  defined by `H5P-005` (S2), which needs the LTI context and the learner pseudonym in a request.
- **Decision:** Build and test `PrismaContentUserDataStorage` in S2 together with `H5P-005`. S1 creates its
  database table, so the schema is complete.
- **Consequences:** The S1 integration test of `H5P-004` covers the other five adapters.

### D-029 · Own licence and audit checks instead of `license-checker` and plain `npm audit`
- **Context:** `NFR-005` suggests `license-checker`; it is unmaintained and pulls in its own dependency
  tree. `SEC-007` allows reviewed, expiring exceptions to `npm audit`, which plain `npm audit` cannot express.
- **Decision:** `tools/dependency-check/checkLicences.mjs` reads production packages with
  `npm query ':not(.dev)'` and checks their SPDX expressions against a GPL-3.0-compatible allow-list.
  `checkAudit.mjs` runs `npm audit --omit=dev --json` and fails on any high or critical advisory that has
  no unexpired entry in `audit-exceptions.json` pointing to a decision here.
- **Consequences:** No extra dependencies. Packages with legacy licence metadata are listed by name and
  version after a person has read their licence file.

### D-030 · Accepted advisory: `image-size` parser loops (until 2027-01-31)
- **Context:** `@lumieducation/h5p-server` 10.0.4 depends on `image-size@^1.0.2`. Advisories
  GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq (JXL and HEIF) and GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr (ICNS) affect every version up to 2.0.2; no
  1.x release is fixed. Version 2 changes the API that `H5PEditor.saveContentFile` calls (it passes a file
  path), so an override would break image uploads. A third advisory (`underscore` ≤ 1.13.7, via `jsonpath`)
  is fixed by an npm `overrides` entry pinning `underscore` 1.13.8, a patch release.
- **Decision:** Accept both `image-size` advisories until **2027-01-31**. The loop is reachable only through
  an authenticated author's file upload. In S2, `SEC-002` content sniffing rejects any file whose magic
  bytes are not on the allowlist (JXL, HEIF and ICNS are not) before H5P calls `image-size`.
- **Consequences:** `audit-exceptions.json` lists both advisories with this decision and the expiry date.
  Review again at expiry, or earlier if h5p-server releases a version with `image-size` ≥ 2.0.3.
